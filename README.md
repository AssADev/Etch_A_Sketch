# Etch A Sketch

Firstly, an **Etch a Sketch** is a toy to create drawings with the particularity of being in the form of pixel art. Often in black and white, this version has a multitude of colours and options to discover.

## The challenge

Secondly, this one was created for fun and to improve my JavaScript skills focusing on :

-   Generate a grid according to the user's choice
-   Have different options to be able to draw
-   Create a pretty, easy to use interface

The live preview is available [here](https://assadev.github.io/Etch_A_Sketch/files/), have fun.
